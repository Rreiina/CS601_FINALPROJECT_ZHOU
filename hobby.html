            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                There are two Twin Lakes in Mono County, the set that begins 10 miles outside of Bridgeport are certainly worthy of a more enticing name—or two.
                Both the Bridgeport Twin Lakes are large. Upper Twin covers nearly 400 acres and Lower Twin more than 250. They are also easy to get to and offer legendary fishing. The boating, camping and cabin rental options at Twin Lakes are top-notch, too. The views the lakes afford, however, are what really distinguish them.
                The large alpine lakes are lined by evergreens and run along what is often called the “Californian Alps;” the Sawtooth Ridge and Sierra Crest, which divide the Twin Lakes Basin from Yosemite National Park.
                While the Twin Lakes Basin is certainly beautiful, it’s also home to some of the best trout fishing in the Golden State. The state record brown trout—weighing in at 26 pounds, 8 ounces—was caught in Upper Twin in 1987. That fish knocked off the reigning champ, which had been landed in Lower Twin Lakes, by just a few ounces.
